# Mom-s-Program-Concept
A simple prototype program I made for my mother now sharing.  For learning, suggestions in new programs and so on. 

Welcome and Readme,
A short time ago, to practice on my programming skills, and as a gift for my mother,
I made a simple application called “Mom’s Program”. It’s a Microsoft® .NET
Framework Application but repurposed. I am now making this available for the public
for concept and as well for commenting on stability/viability and for most importantly
learning. While the program is copyrighted, I only ask that it be used respectfully.
The runtime libraries are included in the event you don’t have them already installed
both 32 and 64 bit depending on your system. Lastly, the program is self extracting
and does not require a formal “installation” though the redistributable from Microsoft®
is included for your convenience.
Thank you,
Kenneth Mitchell
